# SlicerCBM's documentation

**Computational Biophysics for Medicine in 3D Slicer**

[SlicerCBM](https://github.com/SlicerCBM/SlicerCBM) is an extension for [3D Slicer](http://slicer.org) that provides tools for creating and solving computational models of biophysical systems and processes with a focus on clinical and biomedical applications. Features include grid generation, assignment of material properties and boundary conditions, and solvers for biomechanical modeling and biomechanics-based non-rigid image registration.

SlicerCBM is under development at the [Intelligent Systems for Medicine Lab](https://isml.ecm.uwa.edu.au)
at [The University of Western Australia](https://www.uwa.edu.au).
