# SlicerCBM's documentation

**Computational Biophysics for Medicine in 3D Slicer**

SlicerCBM is an extension for 3D Slicer that provides tools for creating and solving computational models of biophysical systems and processes with a focus on clinical and biomedical applications. Features include grid generation, assignment of material properties and boundary conditions, and solvers for biomechanical modeling and biomechanics-based non-rigid image registration.

SlicerCBM is under development at the Intelligent Systems for Medicine Lab at The University of Western Australia.
